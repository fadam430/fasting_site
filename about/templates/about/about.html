        <p>My name is Adam, and I am a Full Stack Software Development student at Code Institute with a strong passion for technology and personal growth. Last year, I experienced a life-changing transformation through fasting, losing 20 kg and developing greater discipline, focus, and awareness about my health.</p>
        <p>That journey not only improved my physical well-being but also strengthened my mindset and confidence. As I continue building my skills in Django and full stack development, I created this platform to combine my personal experience with my technical knowledge. My goal is to provide a supportive, informative, and motivating space for anyone who wants to begin or improve their own fasting journey.</p>
